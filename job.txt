Senior Product Manager - AI & Enterprise Solutions

About the job
THE ROLE



Define and Deliver: Partner with clients and internal squad leads to translate complex business processes into scalable AI-powered solutions.
AI-Driven Execution: Lead AI product implementation — beyond GenAI, LLMs, RAG, recommendation systems, document generation, etc. — from concept to real-world rollout (not just pilots).
Strategic Facilitation: Map cross-industry requirements, manage stakeholders, and guide internal teams through ambiguity, conflict, and delivery pressure.
Vendor & Team Coordination: Identify and manage external vendors, and steer internal AI/engineering teams (even if they’re still growing).
Gritty Leadership: Drive projects across the finish line — pushing through blockers, breaking ceilings when needed, and knowing when to pause or pivot.
Attention to Detail: Act as the final quality gate. Spot when teams are off-track or delivering subpar outcomes, and course-correct early.
Team Grooming: Mentor junior PMs and foster ownership, accountability, and execution excellence across your squad.
Change Management: Manage the rollout and go-to-market for complex products, including user training, adoption, and change impact.


THE REQUIREMENTS



7–10+ years of product or program management experience, ideally in enterprise or consulting environments.
Hands-on experience shipping AI products, not just designing them — especially GenAI, LLMs, RAG, and recommendation systems.
Deep understanding of AI tooling, architecture concepts, and how to connect use cases to real implementations.
Highly self-driven, gritty, and pragmatic — you push things forward even when the path is unclear.
A blend of idealism and realism — you advocate for what’s right, but know how to balance team capacity and practical delivery.
Flawless execution and project management skills. You don’t just delegate — you deliver.
Superb stakeholder management and communication skills, including with C-level clients and diverse industry players.
Strong business acumen, problem mapping, and process design capabilities.
Curious and obsessed with learning the latest in AI, tools, and market trends.
